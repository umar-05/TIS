# TIS

The Information Technology System course has given me a better understanding of how IT supports businesses and everyday life. I learned about key components like hardware, software, networks, and databases, and how they work together to create efficient systems.

One of the most interesting topics was understanding network structures and how data flows securely between devices. Learning about system design and troubleshooting also improved my problem-solving skills.

This course has provided me with a clear understanding of IT infrastructure and how it can be applied to solve real-world challenges, preparing me for future roles in technology-driven environments.
